When would you want to use a remote repository rather than keeping all your work local?
When you are working from differing locations/machines and when you are working as part ofa distributed team
Why might you want to always pull changes manually rather than having Git automatically stay up-to-date with your remote repository?
Manual pulling might be preferable to allow changes only to be pulled through when the user is ready.
In this way, they can work on what they want to and then set aside the time to check the changes rather than 
have them interrupt their own workflow.
Describe the differences between forks, clones, and branches. When would you use one instead of another?
Forks allow people to take online copies through github to their own account in a one way flow.
The fork then allows a clone to be taken to the local computer via gitbash, which can then be synchronised.
Branches at any level allow other versions of something to be worked on, and allowing the merging command 
Which will allow a controlled review of what to merge and any conflicts or allow quick and easy 
Rollback to other branches/versions through the checkout command 
What is the benefit of having a copy of the last known state of the remote stored locally?
It means that conflict resolution can also be attempted offline away from the need for a network connection
